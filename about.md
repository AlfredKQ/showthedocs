# hello

When I don't know what a piece of code does, I will often hit Google to find
the API docs, and then sift through those to find the part that concerns me.

showthedocs is an attempt to improve that workflow by being both a syntax
highlighter and a documentation browser. Given code, it parses and highlights
it, and makes it possible to jump directly to the place in the docs where an
item is explained. It comes with an interactive user interface and aims to be
smarter than a simple Ctrl-F. It is somewhat of an expansion of a former website
I've built, [explainshell](http://explainshell.com).

Please bare in mind that the site is currently in development, so not many
languages are currently supported (and those that are could be further
improved), and other things might not be fully tested. [Help](/contribute) is
definitely welcome!
