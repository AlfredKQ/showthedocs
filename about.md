# hello

showthedocs is an attempt to enrich existing documentation by showing the
reader the parts that are relevant to the code.

A query is given and the documentation is pulled alongside it, where parts of
each are highlighted and connected.

Not many languages are currently supported, and those that are could be
improved further, so [help](/contribute) is definitely welcome!
