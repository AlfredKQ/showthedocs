# hello

When I don't know what a piece of code does, I will often hit Google to find
the API docs, and then sift through those to find the part that concerns me.

showthedocs is an attempt to improve that workflow by giving it the code, and
having it annotate the docs **and** code. It comes with an interactive user
interface that (hopefully) improves on a simple Ctrl-F. It is somewhat of an
expansion of a former website I've built,
[explainshell](http://explainshell.com).

Please bare in mind that the site is currently in development, so not many
languages are currently supported (and those that are could be improved
further), and other things might not be fully tested. [Help](/contribute/) is
definitely welcome!
