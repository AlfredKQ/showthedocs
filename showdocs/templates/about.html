<p>showthedocs is an attempt to enrich existing documentation by showing the reader the parts that are relevant to the code.</p>
<p>A query is given and the documentation is pulled alongside it, where parts of each are highlighted and connected.</p>
<p>Not many languages are currently supported, and those that are could be improved further, so <a href="/contribute">help</a> is definitely welcome!</p>
